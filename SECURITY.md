# Security Policy

This document outlines the security policy for the DreamawareAI project. All contributors, automated agents, and systems must adhere to these principles.

## Core Principle: Zero Trust

We operate under a Zero Trust security model. This means:
- **Never Trust, Always Verify:** Every request, user, and device is treated as untrusted, regardless of its location (internal or external).
- **Least Privilege Access:** Components and contributors are granted the minimum level of access required to perform their function.
- **Explicit Verification:** All access requests are authenticated, authorized, and encrypted before being granted.

## DevSecOps Practices

Security is integrated into every phase of the development lifecycle.

1.  **Secure by Design:** Security considerations are part of the initial design and architecture of any new feature or service. We prioritize security from the outset, not as an afterthought.
2.  **Automated Security Testing:**
    -   **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):** Code is automatically scanned for vulnerabilities before it is merged.
    -   **Dependency Scanning:** All third-party dependencies are scanned for known vulnerabilities.
    -   **Policy as Code (PaC):** Security and infrastructure policies are defined and managed in version control (e.g., using OPA - Open Policy Agent).
3.  **Immutable Infrastructure:** We use infrastructure-as-code to create reproducible and disposable environments. Servers are never modified in place; instead, they are replaced with new, updated instances.
4.  **Continuous Monitoring:** Systems are continuously monitored for security threats and anomalous behavior.
5.  **Secure Coding Standards:**
    -   **Input Validation:** All external input is rigorously validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks.
    -   **No Hardcoded Secrets:** Credentials, API keys, and other secrets must not be stored in source code. They should be managed through a secure vault or secrets management system.
    -   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Code should run with the minimum permissions necessary.

## Vulnerability Disclosure

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to us privately. Do not disclose it publicly until we have had a chance to address it. Contact details will be provided here.

## Compliance

All code and infrastructure must comply with the policies defined in this document. Automated checks will be enforced in the CI/CD pipeline to ensure compliance.
