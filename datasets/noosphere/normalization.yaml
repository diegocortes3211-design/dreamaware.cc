# Placeholder for normalization rules.
# Each step in the normalization process will be defined here.
# For example:
#
# steps:
#   - name: "deduplicate"
#     script: "scripts/deduplicate.py"
#     params:
#       - "--input"
#       - "${input_file}"
#       - "--output"
#       - "${output_file}"
