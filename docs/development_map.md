# Company Development Map

This document outlines the master plan for DreamawareAI's development, detailing our phased approach from foundational security to the deployment of a public, agentic AI platform.

## Phase 1: Foundational Security & Core Infrastructure (Current Phase)

This phase focuses on establishing a secure, stable, and scalable foundation for all future development.

*   **Objective:** Implement a "Security First" culture and a robust DevSecOps pipeline.
*   **Key Results:**
    *   Establish a Zero Trust security policy (`SECURITY.md`).
    *   Automate security scanning (SAST, dependency analysis) in CI/CD.
    *   Implement Policy-as-Code (OPA) for governance.
    *   Develop the core agentic architecture for self-improvement (`Jules v3.0`).
    *   Build foundational data ingestion and processing pipelines.

## Phase 2: Agentic R&D and Autonomous Systems

This phase focuses on advancing our core research pillars and developing autonomous capabilities.

*   **Objective:** Build and refine autonomous agents capable of complex problem-solving and orchestration.
*   **Key Results:**
    *   **Autonomous Multi-Agent Orchestration:** Develop a system where multiple specialized agents can collaborate to achieve complex goals.
    *   **Generative Biological Systems:** Create models capable of simulating and generating novel biological data and structures.
    *   **Real-Time Cognitive Modeling:** Build agents that can model and predict user cognitive states in real-time to provide adaptive assistance.
    *   Develop a comprehensive evaluation framework (e.g., "DABench") to score agent performance on utility, safety, and cost.

## Phase 3: Public Platform & Ecosystem Deployment

This phase involves productizing our agentic systems and opening them up for public use.

*   **Objective:** Launch a secure, scalable, and user-friendly platform for developers and researchers.
*   **Key Results:**
    *   Develop a public-facing API for accessing our core models and agentic services.
    *   Create a developer portal with comprehensive documentation, SDKs, and tutorials.
    *   Build a secure, multi-tenant architecture for the platform.
    *   Establish a community and partner ecosystem around the DreamawareAI platform.

## Phase 4: Decentralization and Long-Term Autonomy

The long-term vision is to create a resilient, decentralized network of AI agents.

*   **Objective:** Evolve the platform into a self-sustaining, decentralized ecosystem.
*   **Key Results:**
    *   Research and implement decentralized AI governance models.
    *   Explore distributed and federated learning architectures.
    *   Develop mechanisms for long-term autonomous operation and self-improvement of the entire network.
