# Atomic Model Architecture

This document outlines the system architecture using a physics-inspired "atomic model." We treat the system like a molecule, where modules are atoms, APIs are bonds, and adversarial testing represents high-energy collisions that validate stability.

## 1. Core Vision

-   **Atoms**: Self-contained modules with a single, clear purpose (e.g., `ExecutiveAgent`, `Gateway`).
-   **Bonds**: The APIs or message channels connecting the atoms.
-   **Collisions**: Adversarial testing (fuzzing, penetration testing) used to validate the strength of bonds and the stability of atoms.

## 2. The Atomic Model

### The Nucleus (Core Agentic System)

The Nucleus contains the core components of the agentic loop, responsible for planning, acting, evaluating, and learning.

| Atom | File | Valence (Public API) | Bonds (Dependencies) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Base Agent** | `services/agentics/agent.py` | `execute_task`, `update_memory`, `get_status` | None |
| **Executive** | `services/agentics/executive.py` | `plan(objective)`, `run(actions)` | `semgrep` (CLI), `opa` (CLI), `dabench/report.json` (File) |
| **Evaluator** | `services/agentics/evaluator.py`| `evaluate(exec_output)` | `Executive` output |
| **SelfModifier**| `services/agentics/self_modify.py`| `propose(evaluation)`, `persist(proposals)` | `Evaluator` output |
| **Orchestrator**| `services/agentics/orchestrator.py`| `run_once(objective)` | `Executive`, `Evaluator`, `SelfModifier` |

### Electron Shells (Peripherals)

The Electron Shells consist of modules that provide services to the Nucleus, such as interfacing with the outside world.

| Atom | File | Valence (Public API) | Bonds (Dependencies) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Gateway** | `api/orchestrator.ts` | `POST /api/orchestrator` (provider, prompt) | OpenAI API, Anthropic API, Groq API |

## 3. Adversarial Collisions (Future Work)

The next phase of development will focus on building a "particle accelerator" (fuzz-testing harness) to fire high-energy inputs at our atoms and bonds to ensure they are resilient.

-   **Fuzz Engine**: Feed random, boundary, and crafted inputs to every API.
-   **Red-Team Agents**: Implement automated scripts in CI to mimic common attack patterns (SQLi, prompt injection, etc.).

## 4. System Synthesis

By defining our system in terms of atoms and bonds, we can:
1.  **Validate** each component's stability with targeted "collisions."
2.  **Assemble** stable atoms into larger, resilient "molecules" (subsystems).
3.  **Evolve** the system by adding new atoms or strengthening bonds with confidence.
