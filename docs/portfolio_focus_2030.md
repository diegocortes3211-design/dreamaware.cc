# Portfolio Focus for 2030

This document defines the strategic R&D pillars for DreamawareAI, guiding our focus toward high-impact areas of innovation through 2030. These pillars represent our core research priorities and long-term vision.

## Pillar 1: Generative Biological Systems

*   **Vision:** To build foundational models capable of understanding, simulating, and generating novel biological data and systems. This includes everything from protein structures and genetic sequences to complex cellular interactions.
*   **Strategic Importance:** This pillar positions us at the forefront of the biotechnology revolution, with potential applications in drug discovery, personalized medicine, and synthetic biology.
*   **Key Research Areas:**
    *   Generative models for protein engineering.
    *   Simulation of cellular signaling pathways.
    *   AI-driven genomics and transcriptomics analysis.

## Pillar 2: Autonomous Multi-Agent Orchestration

*   **Vision:** To create a robust framework where swarms of specialized, autonomous AI agents can collaborate dynamically to solve complex, multi-domain problems that are beyond the scope of any single agent.
*   **Strategic Importance:** This moves beyond single-agent task execution to building truly autonomous systems for science, engineering, and enterprise automation.
*   **Key Research Areas:**
    *   Agent communication protocols and negotiation strategies.
    *   Dynamic task allocation and resource management.
    *   Emergent behavior and collective intelligence.
    *   Human-on-the-loop oversight for complex agent systems.

## Pillar 3: Real-Time Cognitive Modeling

*   **Vision:** To develop AI systems that can build and maintain a real-time model of a user's cognitive state, including attention, cognitive load, and intent. This will enable truly adaptive and personalized human-AI interaction.
*   **Strategic Importance:** This is the key to creating AI assistants that are not just reactive, but proactive and genuinely helpful, anticipating user needs and reducing cognitive friction.
*   **Key Research Areas:**
    *   Multi-modal sensor fusion (e.g., eye-tracking, voice analysis, interaction patterns).
    *   Predictive models of user intent and task performance.
    *   Adaptive user interfaces that respond to cognitive state.
    *   Ethical frameworks for cognitive modeling and intervention.
