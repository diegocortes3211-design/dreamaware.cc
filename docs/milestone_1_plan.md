# Milestone: Phase 1 - Self-Improving Agentic Architecture

This milestone focuses on building the core components of the self-improving agentic system, "Jules." The goal is to create a foundational architecture that can plan, act, evaluate its own performance, and propose improvements.

## Issues

### Issue #1
*   **Title:** `[Feature] Implement Agentic Executive Module`
*   **Body:** This module is responsible for planning and executing actions based on a given objective. It will interpret the objective, load an action catalog, and run a sequence of safe, primarily read-only actions. The initial implementation will not use an LLM for planning but will follow a deterministic set of steps.

### Issue #2
*   **Title:** `[Feature] Implement Agentic Evaluator Module`
*   **Body:** This module converts the raw output from the Executive's actions into a structured evaluation. It will calculate scores for key dimensions like safety and utility, using heuristics or data from pre-existing benchmarks (e.g., `dabench`).

### Issue #3
*   **Title:** `[Feature] Implement Agentic Self-Modifier Module`
*   **Body:** This module is responsible for proposing changes based on the evaluation. It will analyze the scores and generate a list of concrete improvement proposals. Initially, these proposals will be written to a log file and will not modify code directly.

### Issue #4
*   **Title:** `[Feature] Implement Orchestrator for Agentic Loop`
*   **Body:** This component ties the Executive, Evaluator, and Self-Modifier together into a single, runnable loop (Plan -> Act -> Evaluate -> Propose). It will manage the data flow between modules and produce a final report for each run.

### Issue #5
*   **Title:** `[Tests] Add Unit Tests for Agentic Core`
*   **Body:** Create a suite of unit tests to validate the functionality of the Executive, Evaluator, and Self-Modifier modules. Tests should cover the core logic and ensure the data contracts between modules are respected.
*   **Labels:** `ci`, `agentic-ai`
*   **Assignee:** `@me`

### Issue #6
*   **Title:** `[CI] Add GitHub Workflow for Agentic Tests`
*   **Body:** Create a new GitHub Actions workflow that automatically runs the agentic core unit tests on every push and pull request to the `main` branch.
*   **Labels:** `ci`
*   **Assignee:** `@me`

### Issue #7
*   **Title:** `[Docs] Document the Agentic Architecture`
*   **Body:** Create a new documentation page explaining the self-improving architecture, the purpose of each module (Executive, Evaluator, Self-Modifier), and how to run the orchestrator.
