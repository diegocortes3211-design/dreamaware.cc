# Fortress v4 Documentation

Welcome to the Fortress v4 documentation package. This comprehensive documentation addresses Issue #13 by providing detailed analysis, architecture, and migration guidance for the evolution from Voidblock v1 to Fortress v4.

## Overview

Fortress v4 represents a complete architectural redesign built on the lessons learned from Voidblock v1's critical failures. This documentation package provides the foundation for understanding the problems, solutions, and migration strategy.

## Documentation Structure

### üìã Core Documentation

- **[Post-mortem Analysis](postmortem.md)**: Comprehensive analysis of Voidblock v1's architectural flaws
- **[Target Architecture](architecture.md)**: Fortress v4's resilient, zero-trust architecture design  
- **[Migration Plan](migration-plan.md)**: Detailed 28-PR migration strategy with incremental delivery

### üîê Governance Framework

- **[PR Template](../../.github/pull_request_template.md)**: Comprehensive pull request template ensuring governance compliance
- **[Policy Allowlist](../../tools/policy/paths-allow.json)**: Controlled modification policies for different PR types

### ‚öôÔ∏è CI/CD Integration

- **[Documentation Governance Workflow](../../.github/workflows/docs-governance.yml)**: Automated linting, link checking, and policy validation

## Key Architectural Improvements

### 1. Elimination of Single Points of Failure
- **Before**: Centralized orchestrator with no failover
- **After**: Full distributed architecture with CockroachDB and Raft consensus

### 2. Zero-Trust Security Model
- **Before**: Security through obscurity, homebrew crypto
- **After**: SPIFFE/SPIRE identity management, OPA authorization, proven cryptographic standards

### 3. Resilient Data Management
- **Before**: Filesystem-based state with consistency issues
- **After**: ACID-compliant distributed SQL with automatic replication

### 4. Public Anchoring Integrity
- **Before**: No tamper detection capabilities
- **After**: Rekor integration for publicly verifiable audit trails

### 5. Comprehensive Observability
- **Before**: Limited monitoring and alerting
- **After**: Prometheus metrics, distributed tracing, structured logging

## Migration Approach

The migration follows a **4-phase, 28-PR strategy** designed to minimize risk and enable rollback:

```
Phase 1: Foundation (PRs 1-8)      ‚Üí Infrastructure and security baseline
Phase 2: Core Services (PRs 9-16)  ‚Üí Application logic implementation  
Phase 3: Migration (PRs 17-24)     ‚Üí Data migration and traffic cutover
Phase 4: Optimization (PRs 25-28)  ‚Üí Performance tuning and cleanup
```

Each PR is independently deployable with comprehensive rollback capabilities.

## Governance Integration

This documentation package includes governance enhancements to ensure:

- **Quality Control**: Automated markdown linting and link validation
- **Security Compliance**: Policy validation and secret scanning
- **Change Control**: Structured PR templates with approval workflows
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive artifact retention and reporting

## Getting Started

### For Reviewers
1. Start with the [Post-mortem Analysis](postmortem.md) to understand the problems
2. Review the [Target Architecture](architecture.md) for the solution approach
3. Examine the [Migration Plan](migration-plan.md) for implementation strategy

### For Implementation Teams
1. Follow the migration plan's PR-by-PR breakdown
2. Use the PR template for all changes
3. Ensure compliance with policy allowlists
4. Monitor CI governance workflows for quality gates

### For Operations Teams
1. Review deployment requirements in the architecture documentation
2. Prepare infrastructure per the migration plan's Phase 1
3. Establish monitoring and alerting per observability requirements

## Compliance and Quality Assurance

### Automated Checks
- ‚úÖ Markdown linting with markdownlint
- ‚úÖ Link validation with lychee
- ‚úÖ Policy compliance validation
- ‚úÖ Secret scanning with TruffleHog

### Manual Reviews
- Architecture alignment assessment
- Security impact analysis
- Performance implications review
- Operational readiness validation

## Future Work

This documentation package establishes the foundation for:

- **Rekor Anchoring Hardening**: Enhanced public transparency logging
- **Policy Gate Implementation**: Runtime policy enforcement
- **Database-Ledger Features**: Advanced distributed ledger capabilities
- **Zero-Trust Scaffolding**: Complete workload identity management

## Support and Feedback

For questions, issues, or contributions:
- Reference Issue #13 for context
- Use the provided PR template for changes
- Follow governance policies for modifications
- Leverage CI workflows for quality assurance
