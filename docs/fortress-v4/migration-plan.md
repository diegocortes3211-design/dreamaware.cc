# Fortress v4: Migration Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive migration strategy from Voidblock v1 to Fortress v4, structured as a series of incremental pull requests that minimize risk and enable gradual rollout. The migration emphasizes zero-downtime deployment and comprehensive rollback capabilities.

## Migration Principles

1. **Incremental Delivery**: Each PR represents a deployable unit with independent value
2. **Rollback Safety**: Every change must be reversible without data loss
3. **Parallel Operation**: v1 and v4 systems run in parallel during transition
4. **Data Integrity**: Comprehensive validation at every migration step
5. **Observable Progress**: Detailed metrics and monitoring throughout the process
