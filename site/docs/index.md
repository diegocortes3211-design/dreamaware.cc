Dreamaware is an AI first and security driven platform. It hosts a wiki, a developer forum, and a public portfolio of research and experiments. Every pull request is scanned by a Socratic agent, gated by policy, scored by DABench, and logged for provenance.

Use the sidebar to explore the roadmap and visualization guide. The AI futures content and the Xikizpedia scorecard will be linked here as they evolve.
